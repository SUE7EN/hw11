# Fight game 2.0
 
A upgrade version of fight game.
 
## Summary
 
Based on the fight game I made for my Midterm project, I would like to make some changes.
-Make the characters be able to squat.
-Design fancy character to replace the stick figures.
-Add instruction page before the game starts
-Make the players be able to fire more than one bullet per time.
 
## Component Parts
-Change the number in “distance” function and the image of the character to make it be able to squat.
-Use array to fire more than one bullet per time?
-Replace the image for the characters.
